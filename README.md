# Faculty-Editor-Scraper
A web scraper built to gather information about NC State faculty members who edit Elsevier journals.

This scraping tool searches ScienceDirect and pulls information about journal editors affiliated with NC State University. Uses selenium and pandas to scrape and store information.

This specific code scrapes ScienceDirect, but can be changed to accomodate other publisher websites with basic web scraping knowledge.
