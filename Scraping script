PURPOSE: Scrapes ScienceDirect editorial board pages for faculty associated with NC State University. 
NOTES: Selenium CSS selectors are chosen based on ScienceDirect's CSS. Must be edited for other publisher websites.
       Text cleaning in lines 69-76 based on the way ScienceDirect displays editorial information.
       Users must install ChromeDriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to run Chrome through Selenium.
